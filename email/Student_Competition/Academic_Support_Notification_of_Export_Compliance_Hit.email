Hello <first name> <last name>ï¼Œ

Current U.S. laws and export regulations require U.S. companies to obtain approval of export licenses for universities on the U.S. Department of Commerce Entity List maintained by the Bureau of Industry and Security: http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear.  A lengthy process to obtain decision from U.S. Government is required and most likely extends beyond competition due date. 

If this should change in the future we may be able to provide access and services to you, in the meantime we are unable to support this request. 

Thanks for your kind understanding.

Best Regards,
MathWorks Student Competition Program
