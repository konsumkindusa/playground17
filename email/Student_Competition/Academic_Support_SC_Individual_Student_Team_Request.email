Hi Sarah,

I received an Individual Student Team request for {!Academic_Support_Project__c.Account__c}. Iâ€™m forwarding you the request.

Can you please reply back with the list of software and technical lead. If you can have this done by <1 week from the day the email is sent> that would be great.


If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thank you!

Best Regards,
