    <subject>No Charge Renewal Proposal Due [DUE DATE] - {!Contact.Account_Name_Latin__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

The no charge licenses for {!Contact.Account_Name_Latin__c} are set to expire on {!Partner_Agreement__c.Extended_End_Date__c}. This message is to initiate the renewal process, should you want to continue the no charge relationship for another year.

To try and ease the effort on the renewal proposals, please update last yearâ€™s approved proposal with any changes for the upcoming year and send it back to me by [DUE DATE].

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
-Justin
