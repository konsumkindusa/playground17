R14 Student Version Evaluation    Thank you for evaluating our MATLAB & Simulink R14 Student Version for inclusion in your course.  As per your request, I am pleased to send you the instructor's copy.    A passcode to activate the CD will be e-mailed to you shortly, and the CD and instructions will be sent to you by  post.    The CD differs slightly from the CD your student receives in the Student Version box purchased via the campus bookstore.  You are receiving the professional MATLAB CD with instructions on how to run it in 'student mode'.  Your installation process requires passcodes whereas the actual R14 Student Version that the students purchase only requires the Student Version CD for installation.  In addition, we have included in your instructor's copy all of the Toolboxes/Blocksets that a student could potentially add on to their package.     Here are some additional resources you may find helpful as you learn and/or evaluate the ML & SL R14 SV for inclusion in your course:    1.
