Dear [Service Request.Contact Salutation] [Service Request.Contact Last Name],    Thank you for your e-mail enquiring about a 30 day trial of our products.    We regret that it is not our policy to offer free evaluations of our products for student use, however, we do offer the Student Version. The Student Version is a special edition of the software aimed to support students enrolled in full-time courses at degree-granting institutions. It provides the equivalent functionality of the professional version at a significantly reduced cost. This Student Version can be purchased from our website, please see details below.    The Version, which contains Simulink and the functionality of the Symbolic Math Toolbox is available for purchase via our website for $89 + $15 shipping: http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/studentversion/.     Payment may be made by Visa, MasterCard and Switch. Your credit card company will be happy to convert the amount to Sterling for you.    Alternatively, the Student Version is available from Blackwells and some Independent University Bookshops for ï¿½50 including VAT and Delivery. Contact your local bookshop for more details.    A wide range of application specific toolboxes is also available for use with the Student Version and these are available via the website only, with prices starting at $59.00.    If you would like more information or if I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.     Best wishes
