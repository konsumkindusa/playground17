Dear {!Case.Contact},

As the Administrator contact you can use the License Center to remove the current end user on any group member license, and deactivate the software. A redesignation is simply done by first removing the existing user, and then adding a new user to the member license.  Below are the steps for removing and adding an end user to a group member license.

1)      Removing an existing end user on a Group Member Sales Support License
a)      Go to the License Center. 
b)      Select the Group Member license.
Note: When you select a Group license in the license table, only the License Details tab shows. Select a Group Member license to display all tabs with information about the Group Member licenses. 
c)      In the Manage Users and License Contacts tab, click Remove User


2)      Adding a new end user on a Group Member Sales Support License
