Dear {!Case.Contact},

Attached is the MathWorks Software Trials for Your Prospects datasheet that explains how to provide your prospective customers with a trial (time-expiring license) of MATLABÂ®.

To enable us to set up this option for you, please respond to this message with the following:
- Your company name
- Your Connections Program product name

We will then add your company name to the the Partner Trial Request Form. Once you are signed up for this service (we'll send you an e-mail), complete the trial request form each time you need to request a MathWorks trial for a prospect. Please note that this trial service is provided to support software evaluations by your qualified prospects only. 

MathWorks Sales Representatives will follow up with your customer directly.
