Dear {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for your request for regression testing licenses.  Could you answer a couple of questions to help me understand how these need to be set up and to gain the necessary internal approvals?

Questions:
------------
1.   Does your company have a dedicated testing suite set up?  Are those machines tied to people?

2.   In your testing environment, do you perform nightly or on-going testing or is the testing you perform ad-hoc per release?

3.  Which of the following describes your testing activities?

a.   testing customer configurations prior to shipping systems to your customers

b.   performing regression testing in your automated testing environment

c.   if neither a or b above, please describe your testing activities

4.  How many testing machines do you have and how many do you need to outfit with MathWorks products?

In addition, could you indicate who should be the primary contact for this license set up?  Weâ€™ll need their complete contact details including name, company name, shipping address, phone, and e-mail. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Once I receive your response I will be able to send your request out for internal approval.
