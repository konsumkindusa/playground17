This license is currently tagged as your main development license for your MathWorks Connections Program participation. We value your participation in the program, and are sending this reminder so you are aware that you need to keep one license active on SMS in order to maintain your membership in the program. Please renew this license within 30 days of its expiration, or if you are now using a different license number, forward us those details.  

As a reminder, MathWorks Connections Program supports companies that develop and deliver complementary, commercial products and services based on MathWorks products.
