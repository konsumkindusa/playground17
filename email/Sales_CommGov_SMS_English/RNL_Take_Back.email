Hello  {!Contact.FirstName},

I am writing because we have not heard from you regarding the Software Maintenance Service renewal for license #_____, and therefore the maintenance is not current on your software license. If you plan to renew, please let me know and I will send a quote to you. You can also access your quote online through your MathWorks Account. 

By reactivating software maintenance, you can get the latest advances and support you want, including: 

o	Access to new features 
o	Direct technical support 
o	Online license management 
o	Ability to add new products 

Please note that if you renew after the subscription has been lapsed for three months or more, the total cost will include back maintenance from the time your license lapsed, plus a reinstatement fee of 5% of the then-current purchase price of the product. You can renew your license at any time up to four years after expiration. 

You can also choose to decline maintenance for this license. By declining maintenance, you will not receive renewal reminders. The license will remain active, but only at the most current version. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly. 

Kind regards,
