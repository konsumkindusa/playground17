    <textOnly>Dear {!Partner_Agreement__c.Primary_Contact__c},

You are the primary contact for these licenses and responsible for responding to the Annual Worldwide Sales Support Use Report describing your company’s use of Sales Support Licenses with your company’s product, {!Partner_Agreement__c.Partner_Agreement_Name__c} obtained through The MathWorks Connections Program for pre-sales, marketing, and demo purposes. In order to continue using the Sales Support Licenses, you or another representative from your company must complete the annual Web-based report discussed below by June 10, 2017.

The report is now available and should take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.  All responses should be based on activity *during the past year*.  To assist you in answering the Web-based report, we have attached a pdf of the questions you will be asked in the Web report.

Please do not submit your responses using this e-mail.  You will need to average your responses to the report questions for all Sales Support end users worldwide including any distributor end users.
