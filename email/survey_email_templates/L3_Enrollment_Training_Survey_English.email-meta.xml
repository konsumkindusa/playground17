Thank you for attending training from the MathWorks. Our goal is to ensure your success using MATLAB, Simulink, and associated tools for your applications.

We are dedicated to continuously improving your learning experience, and your feedback is important to us. Kindly take a moment to help us understand your change in behavior after the training by taking this survey, which should only take about five (5) minutes of your time.
