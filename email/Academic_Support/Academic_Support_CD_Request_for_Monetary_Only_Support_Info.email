MathWorks is excited to be funding the development of curriculum for the course entitled '{!Academic_Support_Project__c.Name}'.  Attached is an award letter that describes the support.

In order to move forward with the support payment, please provide us with your companyâ€™s bank information for EFT payments using the attached form.     

Please include an Accounts Receivable contact and email.  EFT remittance details will be emailed to the Accounts Receivable email provided each time an EFT payment is made.  

The completed EFT Payment Information Form should be emailed to Accounts.Payable@mathworks.com. 

If your University cannot provide EFT information, please reply to this email and explain why payment must be made by check or wire transfer.
