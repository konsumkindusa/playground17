Hello {!Social_Action__c.Contact__c},

If you have a new charity that you would like MathWorks to support, I suggest nominating them through our End of Year Donations Program. Through this program staff can nominate organizations that they are involved with. Nominations will open in September, and information on how to nominate an organization will be communicated via email, Inside Ad, and Yammer.

Thank You,
Caitlin Brosnihan
