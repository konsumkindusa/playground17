Hello {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for contacting MathWorks. You are currently unable to activate your Student software because you have reached or exceeded the limit for activations.  In order to activate a new machine you must deactivate your software first.  Instructions for deactivating your software are below for your convenience.

Deactivation:

Deactivating an installation renders MathWorks software unusable on a particular computer.  Before deactivating, you must uninstall the program from your machine.  Below you will find instructions on how to uninstall and how to deactivate your software.

To Uninstall on Windows:
1. Shut down the MATLAB Software
2. Start the uninstaller, using any of the following methods.
- On systems running Windows 7, click the Start menu, and select Control Panel.  In the Control Panel, select Programs and Features.  From the list of products displayed, click MATLAB.
-On systems running Windows XP, click the Start menu, select Settings>Control Panel>Add or Remove Programs.  Select MATLAB from the list of products and click Change/Remove.
-Navigate to the matlabroot/uninstall/bin$ARCH folder, where matlabroot is your MATLAB installation folder and $ARCH is a platform-specific subfolder, such as win32.  Double-click the uninstaller executable, uninstall.exe.
3. In the Uninstall Products dialog box, select the products you want to remove and click Uninstall.
	-If you select MATLAB, you automatically remove all other MathWorks products.
4. (Optional) Choose whether to delete downloaded archive files.  If your MATLAB installation folder contains the archive files for downloaded products, the uninstaller displays a message asking if you want to delete these archive files.  The install stores these archive files in the matlabroot/archives folder of your installation.  To remove these files, click yes.
5. To proceed with the removal, click the Uninstall button.  The uninstaller displays the status of the operation as it progresses and displays a dialog box when the operation is complete.  Click Finish to exit the uninstaller.  

To Uninstall on Linux Systems:
1. Exit the MATLAB program
2. Stop the license manager.  To stop the license manager, use the lmdown utility in the matlabroot/etc folder.
3. Enter this command at the Linux prompt:
	rm â€“rf matlabroot
	Where matlabroot represents the name of your top-level MATLAB 	installation folder.

To Uninstall on Macintosh Systems:
1. Get the user name and password of the administrator account on the Macintosh systems.  Depending on where you installed MATLAB software, you might need administrator privileges to remove it.
2. Exit MATLAB and stop the license manager before removing a MATLAB installation.   You can use the lmdown command to stop the license manager.
