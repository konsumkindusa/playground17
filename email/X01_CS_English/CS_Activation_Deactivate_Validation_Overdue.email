Hello {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for contacting MathWorks. In order for you to deactivate your machine, you must provide a deactivation string as your validation status is overdue.  Validation is an automatic, periodic check to ensure the authenticity of License Files in use.  

To deactivate using MATLAB:    Launch MATLAB   
1.    Help Menu -> Licensing -> Deactivate Current License  
2.    Click the "Deactivate Now" button  
3.    Copy the Deactivation String and bring to License Center or provide it to Customer Service.    

This can also be avoided by validating the license, and then deactivating.  The end user can manually force a validation.  To access this feature:    
1.   Open MATLAB  
2.   Select Help > Licensing  
3.   Select Update Current License
