Dear {!Partner_Agreement__c.Primary_Contact__c},

I regret to inform you that your company's membership in The MathWorks Connections Program has been terminated for {!Partner_Agreement__c.Partner_Agreement_Name__c} due to lack of response to program membership requirements.
The Connections Program was developed as a vehicle for third parties who have developed products based on MATLAB and Simulink for commercial distribution.  Membership in this program is dependent on certain criteria, including responsiveness to inquiries.  We cannot continue to offer program benefits to companies that consistently do not meet those expectations.

[LICENSE]

We have tried to contact you regarding your Connections Program development license which is one of the conditions of program membership. Each partner must own at least one commercial license of MathWorks products, and keep it current under our software maintenance service.  Despite multiple attempts to reach you, our records indicate that your license is still out of maintenance.

[T&C RE-ACK]

The Connections Program Team has tried multiple times to contact your organization regarding your annual acknowledgement of The MathWorks Connections Program Terms and Conditions which is one of the conditions of program membership.  Each year, all partners must review and acknowledge continued acceptance of the program terms and conditions.  Despite multiple attempts to reach you, our records indicate that you still have not responded to our requests for annual terms and conditions acceptance.

[PRE-PROD CHECK]
The Connections Program Team has tried multiple times to contact your organization to obtain a status update on the development of {!Partner_Agreement__c.Partner_Agreement_Name__c}.  Your Pre-Product membership is contingent upon on-going development of a MATLAB or Simulink based product or service and bi-annual responses to requests for development status updates.  Despite multiple attempts to reach you, your company has been unresponsive.

This letter details the necessary transition steps to remove your product, [Service Agreement.Name], from the Connections Program. The MathWorks decision to end your Connections Program participation with this product only affects your access to Connections Program-specific benefits for that product.

The specific licenses provided and the initial end users are listed on the attached License Termination Agreement.  Please ensure that these licenses are deleted from all primary and back up systems and that any DVDs or documentation are disposed of appropriately. Once these steps are completed, you must send me a signed copy of the attached License Termination Agreement.  Any other licenses that your organization owns that were purchased under standard license terms for development purposes are not affected by the termination of these restricted use licenses.

Use of License Assignment Process to Resell MathWorks Software
In the past, your company may have used our License Assignment process to resell MathWorks software with your product. You are no longer eligible to use this process and may not resell MathWorks products.
