Dear {!Partner_Agreement__c.Primary_Contact__c}, 

{!Partner_Agreement__c.Account__c} has been acquired by or merged with <Company name>. 

Press Release: <http://www.electronicstalk.com/news/asa/asa124.html>

{!Partner_Agreement__c.Account__c} is currently a Connections Program partner with the product, {!Partner_Agreement__c.Partner_Agreement_Name__c}  (A/B level).  This partner currently has a restricted use license agreement for <Sales Support, Regression Testing, Technical Support>.

My standard process is to have the new company sign all of the agreements that the acquired company signed (tâ€™s and C's, Sales Support, etc.) as long as the new company also acquired the product that is in the Connections Program.  Since you are the focal point for their product I wanted to check in with you to make sure we want them to remain in the program.

Please let me know if I should proceed.

Best Regards, 
{!User.Email_Template_Signature__c} 

Agreement: {!Partner_Agreement__c.Name}
