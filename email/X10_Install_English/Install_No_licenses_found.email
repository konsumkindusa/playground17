Thank you for contacting MathWorks Support. I was not able to find any licenses associated with your MathWorks Account. In order to download MATLAB, you must be associated with a valid license.

If you are a student or faculty member at a college or university, your school may have a Total Academic Headcount license you can use. If your school has a Total Academic Headcount license, you can find it here:
